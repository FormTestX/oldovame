	<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
	<p>We came from zero to become a hero and now we are hero to help 	others.<br>
	Our dream is to show everyone how easy is coding. We know a lot of 	people using website builder and pay monthly or yearly to remove the 	watermark and unlock pro features. But we can save more money when 	we code our own website.<br><br>
	
	As a young coder, and yes I don't call my self a developer because 	we are not good enough. But guess what? I manage to publish and 	run this website to public. Just believe yourself and keep moving. 
	Never give up!
